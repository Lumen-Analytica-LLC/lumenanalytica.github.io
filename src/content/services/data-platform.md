Our Data Platform service provides organizations with a scalable, secure, and high-performance platform for centralizing, integrating, and analyzing business data. We design and implement modern data warehouse solutions tailored to your business needs, enabling advanced analytics, reporting, and data-driven decision-making.

A data warehouse unifies disparate systems — ERP, CRM, HRM, accounting software — into a governed, performant foundation for analytics. Instead of siloed exports and spreadsheets, your teams gain self-service access to trusted, real-time insights through tools like [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/).

**Working with Existing Systems:**

Your accounting software (QuickBooks, Xero) remains your system of record for financial compliance and reporting. The data warehouse extends its value by combining accounting data with customer behavior, operational metrics, and revenue analytics across all business systems. You preserve data lineage, enable long-term retention, and run advanced queries without impacting production workloads.

Our data pipelines (see [Software Development](/services/software-development)) ingest, transform, and deliver data reliably — with schema validation, error handling, and observability built in. Governance frameworks (see [Governance, Risk & Compliance](/services/governance)) ensure security, compliance (GDPR, SOC 2, HIPAA), and role-based access controls from day one.

**Statement of Work:**

- Discovery and requirements gathering with stakeholders across finance, operations, and analytics teams
- Architecture design for scalability, security, data governance, and disaster recovery
- Data source assessment and integration planning (APIs, databases, flat files, streaming)
- Data modeling (dimensional, vault, or hybrid) aligned with business KPIs
- ETL/ELT pipeline development with automated testing and monitoring
- Data quality framework implementation (validation, anomaly detection, lineage tracking)
- Security and compliance configuration (encryption, audit logs, access controls)
- Visualization layer setup (Metabase, Tableau, Looker) with starter dashboards
- Performance tuning and optimization for query speed and cost efficiency
- User acceptance testing, training, and technical documentation
- Post-deployment monitoring, maintenance, and continuous improvement support

**Deliverables:**

- Data warehouse architecture documentation with infrastructure diagrams
- Production-ready data warehouse with configured environments (dev, staging, prod)
- Automated data pipelines with scheduling, error handling, and alerting
- Data catalog and lineage documentation for end users
- Dimensional or normalized data models with business glossary
- Self-service BI dashboards and reporting templates
- Security and compliance audit reports
- User training materials and administrator runbooks
- Performance monitoring dashboards and SLA definitions
- Ongoing support and enhancement plan
